I've tried twice now and wasted almost an hour. This is blocking my reimbursement before month-end close. Really frustrating because I need this money back ASAP.","Confirmed this is related to known incident INC-2024-0892 affecting Workday expense attachments. The attachment processing service was overwhelmed due to Monday morning peak + month-end volume. Advised associate to split submission into batches of 5 receipts maximum.
