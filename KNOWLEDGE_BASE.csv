If you're experiencing timeouts or slow performance when submitting expense reports in Workday, follow these troubleshooting steps:

## Common Causes
- Large number of attachments (more than 10 receipts)
- High-resolution images that exceed recommended file sizes
- Peak usage times (Monday mornings, month-end deadlines)
- Browser cache issues

## Step-by-Step Resolution

### 1. Reduce Attachment Size
- Compress images before uploading
- Each receipt should be under 2MB
- Use your phone's document scanner feature for better compression
- Convert HEIC images to JPEG format

### 2. Batch Your Submissions
If you have more than 10 receipts:
- Split them across multiple expense reports
- Submit 5-7 receipts per report
- Wait for confirmation before starting the next batch

### 3. Avoid Peak Hours
- Monday mornings (8-10 AM EST) see highest traffic
- Month-end deadlines (13th-15th of each month) have 40% higher volume
- Best times to submit: Before 8 AM, after 2 PM, or Tuesday-Thursday

### 4. Clear Browser Cache
- Chrome: Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data
- Edge: Settings > Privacy > Clear browsing data
- Select 'Cached images and files'

### 5. Check System Status
Visit the IT Status page (ServiceNow > IT Status Dashboard) to check for known issues.

## When to Contact Support
If the problem persists after trying these steps:
- Open a support ticket: Category 'Software' > Subcategory 'Workday' > Issue 'Expense Reports'
- Include: Number of receipts, file sizes, error message screenshot
- Priority: P2 for month-end deadline, P3 for routine submissions

KB-2024-003,iPhone Receipt Photo Best Practices for Expense Reports,Software,Concur,HOW_TO,2023-08-10,2024-01-10,3456,234,98,"# iPhone Receipt Photo Best Practices for Expense Reports

Follow these guidelines to ensure your iPhone receipt photos upload successfully to Concur and Workday.

## The HEIC Issue
By default, iPhones capture photos in HEIC format, which some expense systems have trouble processing. Here's how to fix it:

### Option 1: Change iPhone Camera Settings (Recommended)
1. Open Settings > Camera > Formats
2. Select 'Most Compatible' instead of 'High Efficiency'
3. This captures photos as JPEG which is universally supported

### Option 2: Use the Notes App Document Scanner
The Notes app has a built-in scanner that:
- Automatically enhances contrast (great for faded receipts!)
- Saves as PDF or JPEG
- Crops to receipt edges automatically

**How to use:**
1. Open Notes app > Create new note
2. Tap camera icon > Scan Documents
3. Position receipt and let it auto-capture
4. Tap Save > Share > Save to Photos

### Option 3: Convert Existing HEIC Photos
If you already have HEIC photos:
1. Email the photo to yourself
2. iPhone automatically converts to JPEG when emailing
3. Save the JPEG from email to upload

## Photo Quality Tips
- **Lighting:** Photograph receipts in good lighting, avoid shadows
- **Angle:** Capture straight-on, not at an angle
- **Focus:** Tap the receipt to focus before capturing
- **Size:** Keep photos under 2MB for fastest upload

## Faded Receipt Solutions
For thermal paper receipts that fade quickly:
1. Scan immediately after receiving
2. Use Notes app scanner - it enhances contrast
3. If already faded, increase exposure in Photos app before uploading

## File Size Guidelines
- Target: Under 2MB per image
- Maximum: 10MB (but may cause timeouts)
- Batch submission limit: 5-7 images recommended

**Recommended for Large Meetings:**
- 16GB RAM
- Quad-core processor
- 10+ Mbps internet

**Your Laptop:** Check specs in Settings > System > About

## Before Important Meetings

### Close Unnecessary Applications
Teams with video uses significant resources. Before large meetings:
1. Close Chrome tabs (each tab uses memory)
2. Quit Slack if not needed
3. Close large Excel files
4. Exit any video streaming

### Check Your Setup
1. Test audio/video: Teams > Settings > Devices > Make a test call
2. Ensure good lighting for video

## During Screen Sharing

### Optimize for Performance
1. Share specific window instead of entire screen
2. Close confidential apps before sharing
3. Use 'Include system audio' only when needed
4. Disable 'Include video' if not necessary

### For Large Meetings (50+ Participants)
1. Consider disabling incoming video: '...' > Turn off incoming video
2. Use 'Together Mode' or 'Gallery' instead of 'Large Gallery'
3. Presenters should use wired internet connection

## Troubleshooting Crashes

### Teams Crashes During Video/Screen Share
Common cause: Insufficient RAM or GPU driver issues

**Solutions:**
1. Restart Teams: Right-click system tray icon > Quit > Reopen
2. Clear Teams cache: %appdata%\\Microsoft\\Teams\\Cache (delete contents)
3. Update display drivers: Device Manager > Display adapters > Update driver
4. Disable GPU acceleration: Settings > General > Disable GPU hardware acceleration

2. Review and delete unnecessary large emails
3. For needed attachments, save to OneDrive and delete email

### Empty Deleted Items
Deleted emails still count toward quota:
1. Right-click Deleted Items folder
