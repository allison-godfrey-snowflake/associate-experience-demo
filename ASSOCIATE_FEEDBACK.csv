FB-2024-001,2024-01-15 14:30:00,A-78234,IN_APP,Workday,2,NEGATIVE,Commercial Banking,"Very frustrating experience this morning trying to submit my expense report. Took almost 5 hours from first attempt to finally getting it through. I understand systems have issues but there should be better communication when something is wrong. I wasted a lot of time before finding out there was a workaround. Month-end deadlines are stressful enough without this.","expense timeout workday communication frustration"
FB-2024-002,2024-01-15 15:45:00,A-67234,SURVEY,Workday,1,NEGATIVE,Card Services,"Unacceptable experience with the expense system today. As an SVP I should not have to spend my morning fighting with technology. I had to escalate through multiple levels before anyone could fix my issue. The workaround should have been communicated proactively. I expect better from our IT organization.","expense escalation executive experience leadership"
FB-2024-003,2024-01-15 16:20:00,A-89012,IN_APP,Workday,4,POSITIVE,Commercial Banking,"Had an issue with expense reports this morning but IT support was really helpful.

Good support experience despite the system issues.","expense support positive resolution"
FB-2024-004,2024-01-15 17:00:00,A-45123,SURVEY,Okta,5,POSITIVE,Commercial Banking,"Great tip from IT about setting up backup MFA options! I never knew I could use offline codes.

FB-2024-005,2024-01-15 17:30:00,A-12345,IN_APP,Microsoft Teams,3,NEUTRAL,Retail Banking,"Teams crashed during my presentation which was embarrassing but IT helped me understand it's a hardware limitation. I submitted a laptop refresh request but concerned about how long it will take. Would be nice if there was proactive monitoring to identify laptops that need upgrades before they cause issues.","teams crash hardware proactive monitoring suggestion"
FB-2024-006,2024-01-15 11:45:00,A-23789,SURVEY,VPN,4,POSITIVE,Retail Banking,"VPN issue this morning was resolved relatively quickly once I got to IT.

The support agent taught me something new that will save time going forward. This should be more widely communicated. Maybe a tips newsletter or something?","sharepoint onedrive tips training newsletter"
FB-2024-008,2024-01-16 10:30:00,A-56234,SURVEY,Excel,5,POSITIVE,Commercial Banking,"IT helped me understand Power Pivot and now my giant spreadsheet actually works.

This cost me an entire morning of productivity during a busy period. The emergency certificate process seems too slow for critical issues like this. When remote workers can't connect that should be treated as a P1 from the start.","vpn certificate outage productivity p1 priority"

FB-2024-014,2024-01-12 14:30:00,A-23456,SLACK_BOT,General,3,NEUTRAL,Technology,"Overall IT systems are okay but I feel like we hear about issues after they're already affecting us. Would love to see more proactive communication - maybe a status dashboard we can check, or alerts for known issues. Sometimes I spend 30 minutes troubleshooting before finding out it's a known problem.","communication proactive status dashboard alerts"
FB-2024-015,2024-01-11 11:00:00,A-89345,SURVEY,Microsoft Teams,4,POSITIVE,Card Services,"Had audio issues during a call but IT helped me troubleshoot. Turns out it was a Bluetooth issue.
